Bootstrap Introduction and Project

What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components for typography, navigation, forms, buttons, modals, and more. Bootstrap is one of the most popular front-end development frameworks in the world, and it is used by millions of developers to create websites and web applications.

Getting Started with Bootstrap

To get started with Bootstrap, you can add the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files to your HTML page. You can download these files from the Bootstrap website or use a content delivery network (CDN) such as Google Hosted Libraries.

Once you have added the Bootstrap files to your HTML page, you can start using Bootstrap components to build your website. For example, to create a button, you can use the following HTML:

HTML
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Button</button>

This will create a blue button with the text "Button". You can also customize the button's appearance by adding additional CSS classes.
